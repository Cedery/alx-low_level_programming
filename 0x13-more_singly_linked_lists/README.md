This is the readme file for the project more singly linked list, the followjng are the explanation of each files:

1. '0-print_listint.c' contains a function for printing all elements within a 'listint_t' linked list.
2. '1-listint_len.c' holds a function to determine the number of elements in a 'listint_t' linked list.
3. '2-add_nodeint.c' includes a function to add a new node to the beginning of a 'listint_t' linked list.
4. '3-add_nodeint_end.c' provides a function to add a new node to the end of a 'listint_t' linked list.
5. '4-free_listint.c' consists of a function for freeing memory associated with a 'listint_t' linked list.
6. '5-free_listint2.c' contains a function for freeing the list and setting the head pointer to NULL.
7. '6-pop_listint.c' offers a function to remove the head node of a 'listint_t' linked list and return its data (n).
8. '7-get_nodeint.c' contains a function to retrieve the nth node of a 'listint_t' linked list.
9. '8-sum_listint.c' provides a function to calculate the sum of all data (n) in a 'listint_t' linked list.
10. '9-insert_nodeint.c' holds a function to insert a new node at a specified position.
11. '10-delete_nodeint.c' includes a function to delete the node at a given index in a 'listint_t' linked list.
12. '100-reverse_listint.c' features a function to reverse a linked list.
13. '101-print_listint_safe.c' offers a function to print a 'listint_t' linked list safely.
14. '102-free_listint_safe.c' contains a function to safely free memory associated with a 'listint_t' linked list.
15. '103-find_loop.c' provides a function to detect and locate loops within a linked list.
16. 'lists.h' serves as the header file containing prototypes for all these functions, as well as the 'listint_t' data structure."
